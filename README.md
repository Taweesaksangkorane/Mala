Project Background 

Nowadays, Ma La store are widely popular, especially among students, students and working age. Most 
of the shops still use traditional management methods, such as recording customer lists, calculating prices, 
and counting stocks by hand, which easily causes mistakes such as miscalculating money, forgetting to cut 
stock, or having unsystematic customer information, resulting in delays in service and lack of credibility. 
To solve these problems, Ma La store management system has been developed that has the ability to work 
in many aspects effectively.

selected products to the store staff to charge. 
• Automatic price calculation  - The system will charge according to the price of each product type and the number of wood. 
• Check and update stock - The system will automatically deduct the number of products after the customer orders. 
• Reading/writing files - Keep customer and product information in a file for data security.
